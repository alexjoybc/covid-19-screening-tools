          <p>The online COVID-19 self-assessment tool allows you to enter certain identifying and personal health information related to your potential COVID-19 symptoms. It is not intended to provide medical advice. Consult a health practitioner or your local public health unit if you have medical questions.</p>

          <h2 id="how-we-use">How we use your information</h2>
          <p>Your information is provided to the Ministry of Health. The ministry maintains the tool and all information that is put into the tool. Ontario Health, a provincial agency, acts on behalf of the ministry to facilitate the management of your information.</p>
          <p>The ministry will only use or disclose the information you provide in the tool to investigate, eliminate or reduce the current COVID-19 outbreak risk. It will not be used for any other purposes.</p>
